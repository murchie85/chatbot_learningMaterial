It cant be anybody else! she said to herself. Im as certain of it, as if his name were written all over his face.\n",

    "It might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous face. Humpty Dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a Turk, on the top of a high wallsuch a narrow one that Alice quite wondered how he could keep his balanceand, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction, and he didnt take the least notice of her, she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how exactly like an egg he is! she said aloud, standing with her hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to fall.\n",

    "Its very provoking, Humpty Dumpty said after a long silence, looking away from Alice as he spoke, to be called an eggVery!\n",

    "I said you looked like an egg, Sir, Alice gently explained. And some eggs are very pretty, you know she added, hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment.\n",

    "Some people, said Humpty Dumpty, looking away from her as usual, have no more sense than a baby!\n",
    "\n",

    "Must a name mean something? Alice asked doubtfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course it must, Humpty Dumpty said with a short laugh: my name means the shape I amand a good handsome shape it is, too. With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.\n",

    "Why do you sit out here all alone? said Alice, not wishing to begin an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why, because theres nobody with me! cried Humpty Dumpty. Did you think I didnt know the answer to that? Ask another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dont you think youd be safer down on the ground? Alice went on, not with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured anxiety for the queer creature. That wall is so very narrow!\n",
    "\n",
    "What tremendously easy riddles you ask! Humpty Dumpty growled out. Of course I dont think so! Why, if ever I did fall offwhich theres no chance ofbut if I did Here he pursed his lips and looked so solemn and grand that Alice could hardly help laughing. If I did fall, he went on, The King has promised mewith his very own mouthtoto\n",

    "I havent, indeed! Alice said very gently. Its in a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, well! They may write such things in a book, Humpty Dumpty said in a calmer tone. Thats what you call a History of England, that is. Now, take a good look at me! Im one that has spoken to a King, I am: mayhap youll never see such another: and to show you Im not proud, you may shake hands with me! And he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so) and offered Alice his hand. She watched him a little anxiously as she took it. If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind, she thought: and then I dont know what would happen to his head! Im afraid it would come off!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, all his horses and all his men, Humpty Dumpty went on. Theyd pick me up again in a minute, they would! However, this conversation is going on a little too fast: lets go back to the last remark but one.\n",

    "In that case we start fresh, said Humpty Dumpty, and its my turn to choose a subject (He talks about it just as if it was a game! thought Alice.) So heres a question for you. How old did you say you were?\n",
